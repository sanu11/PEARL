realDonaldTrump,8/13/2018 9:09,Just fired Agent Strzok  formerly of the FBI  was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!,-0.028571429,negative,
realDonaldTrump,8/13/2018 9:04,Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt  will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion  No Obstruction - I just fight back!,-0.175,negative,
realDonaldTrump,8/13/2018 8:12,The very unpopular Governor of Ohio (and failed presidential candidate) @JohnKasich hurt Troy Baldersonâ€™s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate. Even Kasichâ€™s Lt. Governor lost Gov. race because of his unpopularity. Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN!,0.268055556,positive,
realDonaldTrump,8/13/2018 7:21,While I know itâ€™s â€œnot presidentialâ€ to take on a lowlife like Omarosa  and while I would rather not be doing so  this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!,-0.085,negative,
realDonaldTrump,8/13/2018 6:50,...really bad things. Nasty to people & would constantly miss meetings & work. When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser & nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out  if possible  because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired!,-0.116666667,negative,
realDonaldTrump,8/13/2018 6:27,Wacky Omarosa  who got fired 3 times on the Apprentice  now got fired for the last time. She never made it  never will. She begged me for a job  tears in her eyes  I said Ok. People in the White House hated her. She was vicious  but not smart. I would rarely see her but heard....,-0.17244898,negative,
